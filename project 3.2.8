Beware of monthy hall

Assuming that the hosts of the show won't put someone behind the stage to tamper with what is behind the doors, the probability that there 
be a prize behind the door I pick is 1/3. If the host opens one of the doors, shows me dud, and then gives me a chance to change my choice, well,
that should only mean that the probability that I picked the right one has increased to 1/2 and it is just as likey as changing my choice.

Baye's rule should equate to the same probability of 1/2 for the remaining two doors given that the chance of finding a a prize behind the 
third door is zero.
