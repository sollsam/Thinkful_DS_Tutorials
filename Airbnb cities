-- I'm using Airbnb listings for Bristol City in England 
--1. The most expensive listing in Bristol is called Cozy room in Bristol and costs 7500 USD

SELECT 
	name,
	price
FROM 
	bristol_listings
ORDER BY price DESC 

-- Other facts 
--There are 2073 listings and 1473 hosts in Bristol city   

SELECT 
	COUNT(DISTINCT host_id) AS number_of_hosts,
	COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS number_of_listings
FROM

-- 2. What neighborhoods seem to be the most popular?
-- I used the number of reviews as a measure of popularity which means Windmill hill is the most popular neighbourhood for listings in Bristol

	number_of_reviews
FROM 
	bristol_listings
ORDER BY number_of_reviews DESC


-- 3. What time of year is the cheapest time to go to your city? What about the busiest?
--unfortunately the data set I choose doesn't have time columns to answer the question
