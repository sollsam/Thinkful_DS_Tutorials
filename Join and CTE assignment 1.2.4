--1. What are the three longest trips on rainy days?

(SELECT 
  date
FROM 
  weather
WHERE 
  events = 'Rain'
GROUP BY 1
)

SELECT
  trip_id,
  duration,
  start_date
FROM 
  trips
JOIN 
  rainy
on rainy.date = start_date
ORDER BY duration DESC
LIMIT 3

--2. Which station is full most often?

SELECT
  status.station_id,
  stations.name,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN docks_available=0 then 1 END) empty_count
FROM 
  status
JOIN 
  stations
  on stations.station_id = status.station_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY empty_count DESC

--3. Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips starting at that station but ordered by dock count.

SELECT
 start_station,
 dockcount,
 COUNT(*)
FROM 
  trips
JOIN 
  stations
ON 
  stations.name=trips.start_station
GROUP BY 1, 2
order by 2 DESC
--4. (Challenge) What's the length of the longest trip for each day it rains anywhere?

WITH
  rainy
AS
  
(SELECT 
  date
From 
  weather
WHERE 
  events = 'Rain'
GROUP BY 1
),

rain_trips 
AS
(
SELECT
  trip_id,
  duration,
  DATE(start_date) trip_date
FROM 
  trips
JOIN 
  rainy
ON
  rainy.date = trip_date
ORDER BY duration DESC
)

SELECT 
  trip_date,
  max(duration)
FROM
  rain_trips
GROUP BY 1
